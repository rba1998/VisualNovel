<The year 2022 has come, and yet the world, or at least our world, is still in shambles. We thought things would get better, but some people were just too selfish.
<The virus has spread far and wide, and zombies now walk among us.
<It's scary. We're scared. We've been holed up in this library for a few weeks now- or has it been months? It's hard to keep track anymore.

<Hey Mary, did you find us some of the good stuff?

<By "good stuff", I hope you mean another extra big can of beans like the one Mary scored at the supermarket last week.

<Haha...
<You see, well...
<I searched everywhere in the vicinity and I couldn't find anything. I think we've wiped this place pretty much clean.
<Don't you think we should try to camp somewhere else, so we can find more resources?

<Both Jay and Faith suddenly look a little uneasy.

<You know we can't leave the library. It's just way too dangerous for Jay and I.
!2r
<Yeah. I'm sure we can find some other source of food soon.

<Well we better find some soon, because I am absolutely STARVING. I'd eat anything...

<I'm sorry Faith... I'm sure I'll find something...

<Are you sure you don't have anything on your person? At all?

<Faith is suddenly acting a bit strangely. I couldn't say what it is, but... something seems off.

<Humans...

<They do have some meat on their bones.
<You're not using your pinky anyways, right?
!5r
<What?
<This has to be some kind of insane joke, but...
<Faith seems completely serious.
<DEAD serious.

<Mary... we'll starve! You don't want that...
<...right?
!5r
<...well...
<Friends do need to make sacrifices for each other...
<...right?
